Scripts I like to keep handy for running my node.

Script Name | Function
----------- | --------
**acsplit** | Create UTXOs as needed although Iguana handles this as long as you didn't hit the base58 lottery
**coinlist** | Handy way to keep coin list in one place for other scripts to use (thanks to a-team)
**fail2banstatusall** | Get stats of fail2ban jails
**freshubuntu** | Run this for initial setup of your server for basic security needs (generalized on purpose so it can be used on any server)
**killthemall** | Hard kill komodo related processes
**killthemsoftly** | Kill komodo processes nicely
**kmdacfirewall** | UFW settings with commentary
**networktweaksundo.txt** | Reference to my default Ubuntu 16.04 net config "just in case"
**notary** | Start notary process
**notarytest** | Start notary test process
**rebuildkomodo** | Git pull and rebuild komodo on the current branch
**start** | Start chipsd and komodod
**startac** | Start assetchains
**stats** | Fancy cli stats for notary nodes
